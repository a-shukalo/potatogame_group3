- **Learn enemy patterns** - they always move directly toward you

### Mid Game (Waves 4-6)
- **Use your increased stats** - you should be faster and stronger
- **Manage your health** - health only restores on level up
- **Position strategically** - use screen edges to funnel enemies
- **Keep moving** - stationary targets are easy to hit

### Late Game (Wave 7+)
- **Master kiting** - shoot while moving away from enemies
- **Optimize experience collection** - don't miss any orbs
- **Use your range advantage** - shoot enemies before they reach you
- **Plan your movements** - 60-second waves require endurance

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Circle Strafing**: Move in circles around groups of enemies
2. **Backpedaling**: Walk backward while shooting approaching enemies  
3. **Wall Usage**: Use screen edges to prevent enemies from surrounding you
4. **Experience Management**: Clear enemies near experience orbs for easy collection
